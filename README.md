Video Demo: ONLY WATCH AFTER YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED THE ASSIGNMENT




 Create form inputs with First Name, Last Name, Email, Password and Confirm Password fields
 Display, in real time, the form data that is being typed in below the form
 
 Version 1 is having the state within the child component and displaying the data in the same single component
 Version 2 is having 2 separate components to have the form and to display data. The state is within the parent App.js
 Version 3 is lifting state where we have 2 components for the form and displaying data but the state is within the child component. ALso version-3 has a less-tedious way of writing state variables by using an object of variables instead. Version-1 has each state variable written out. This version also has front-end form validations. Front-end validations are ok for minor checks but for more complicated checks, let the back-end server handle the validations. Front-end validations is not as secure.
